The AI engineer successfully enhanced the Text2toss Junk-Removal-app through several development phases. Initially, focus was on fixing admin dashboard UI issues, specifically cut-off and overlapping buttons across various modals for improved mobile responsiveness. A major task involved securing the admin login with a username/password system ( / ), hashed passwords, and JWT tokens. Twilio SMS was integrated, but delivery issues linked to pending 10DLC registration were identified. Extensive efforts were made to clean the Git history by removing hardcoded secrets and  files to resolve GitHub push protection errors. Google Maps integration was set up, and a deployment health check revealed and fixed critical hardcoded credentials and webhook URLs. The pricing model was refined from a 1-10 to a 1-20 scale, with lower price points and expanded auto-approval. Visuals were updated with a user-specified hexagonal background and a functional contact section. The current work involves transitioning the app to use **Venmo as the sole payment method**, removing all Stripe-related elements from the UI.

<current_work>
The most immediate work involves transitioning the Text2toss Junk-Removal-app to exclusively use **Venmo for payments**. The user explicitly requested to only use venmo fro payment methode after providing their Venmo business account details ().

The AI engineer has initiated this process in the  frontend file:
1.  **Stripe Removal from UI**: Elements related to Stripe payments, such as the Pay with Card button and any associated modals, have been removed from the booking flow in .
2.  **Venmo Booking Handler**: A new function, , has been added to  to manage the Venmo payment process. This will likely involve generating a Venmo payment link or displaying QR code instructions.
3.  **UI Text Updates**: The How It Works section and the main hero section of the application have been updated to explicitly mention and promote Venmo as the sole payment option, aligning the user interface with the new payment strategy.
The last action was restarting the frontend service to apply these changes, ensuring the user sees the updated payment options immediately.

<optional_next_step>
Test the frontend to verify that all Stripe payment elements are removed and the Venmo-only payment flow is correctly implemented and functional.
