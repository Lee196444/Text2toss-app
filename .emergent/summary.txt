The previous AI engineer developed a Text2toss Junk-Removal-app from scratch, focusing on delivering core value quickly. Initial work involved setting up a React frontend and FastAPI backend, establishing basic junk removal quoting and booking. Subsequent iterations introduced a hexagonal background, an admin dashboard with daily/weekly schedules, and Google Maps integration (awaiting API key). The engineer then enhanced the app with AI-powered quote generation using image upload, refined the service to ground/curbside pickup only, and fixed a non-functional Learn More button. Key security was added with a simple admin password login. Advanced features included completion photo uploads for admin and automated SMS notifications (in simulation mode) using Twilio. Branding was consistently updated to TEXT-2-TOSS with a real job photo. The dashboard was reorganized into a bin-based system, and calendar/time slot booking restrictions were implemented. Throughout, the engineer addressed several bugs, including backend date handling, MongoDB serialization, frontend component imports, and ensured comprehensive testing, apologizing for prior incomplete fixes to build trust.

<product_requirements>
The Text2toss Junk-Removal-app aims to streamline junk removal by offering instant quotes. The core problem solved is providing quick, transparent pricing without callbacks and efficient job management for the service provider.

**Implemented Features:**
*   **Instant Quoting:** Users describe junk items (text or photo upload) and receive AI-powered quotes in seconds. The AI considers item details, location, and service limitations (ground/curbside only).
*   **Booking System:** Customers can schedule pickups based on available dates and time slots, with restrictions preventing bookings on Fridays/weekends and preventing double-booking.
*   **Admin Dashboard:** A password-protected interface for the service provider to manage operations.
    *   **Bin-based Job Management:** Organizes jobs into New, Upcoming, In Progress, and Completed bins with counts and revenue.
    *   **Daily/Weekly Schedule:** View all scheduled pickups, including customer photos (uploaded during quoting).
    *   **Completion Photos:** Admins can upload photos of cleaned areas after job completion.
    *   **Route Optimization:** A Start Route button (functionality partially implemented, with issues) opens a map to the pickup location.
    *   **SMS Notifications:** Automated text messages to customers for job status updates (booked, started, completed) and completion photos (simulation mode, requires Twilio credentials).
    *   **Image Management:** Customer-uploaded images are only permanently stored upon booking; temporary images are cleaned up.
*   **User Interface:** Modern, responsive design using Shadcn UI components, a dark hexagonal background, and improved text contrast. The hero section features TEXT-2-TOSS branding, a real job photo, and highlights instant photo quotes and no callbacks. Learn More button scrolls to How It Works section.

<current_work>
The most recent work involved implementing a comprehensive calendar and time slot management system within the  component on the customer-facing frontend. This system now prevents customers from scheduling pickups on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays by displaying a clear warning and visually blocking these days in the calendar. Furthermore, it manages time slot availability, preventing double bookings by checking existing appointments for a selected date and visually marking unavailable slots as ðŸš« Booked. The backend has been updated with an  endpoint to check for available slots and includes server-side validation in the booking creation endpoint to ensure no double bookings occur and that restricted days are respected, even if frontend checks are bypassed. The AI engineer successfully tested this feature, confirming that Friday (9/26) was blocked and Thursday (9/25) correctly showed one booked slot and multiple available slots.
